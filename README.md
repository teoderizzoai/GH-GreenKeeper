# 🌱 GH-GreenKeeper

*Growing forests to keep your GitHub profile green, one tree at a time*

![GitHub Contribution Graph Example](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=1000,height=420,fit=cover,gravity=auto,format=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fexirmgixmnkgwo40q1ig.PNG)

*This is what your contribution graph could look like with GH-GreenKeeper - a lush, verdant forest of green squares!*

## 🌲 What is this forest?

Welcome to **GH-GreenKeeper**, where we plant digital trees to transform your GitHub contribution graph into a thriving forest. Instead of motivational quotes, we grow actual forests of tree emojis that keep your profile looking fresh and green.

This project automatically plants trees in your repository 4 times a day, ensuring your GitHub profile stays as green as a spring meadow. Because nothing says "productive developer" like a perfectly green contribution graph, right?

## 🎯 Features

- **🌲 Tree Emoji Forests**: Plants beautiful tree emojis instead of boring text
- **🌳 Natural Growth Pattern**: Randomizes commits to create realistic green squares
- **🌴 Variable Forest Density**: 1-4 trees per run for different shades of green
- **🌵 Realistic Seasons**: 15% chance to skip runs (even forests need rest!)
- **🎄 Forest Variety**: 2 different tree types (🌲 evergreen, 🌳 deciduous)
- **🎋 Growing Forests**: Multiple trees per commit creating mini ecosystems
- **🎍 Clean Format**: Simple forest entries without clutter
- **🎎 Sustainable Growth**: Because even digital forests need care

## 🚀 How the forest grows

1. **🌱 GitHub Actions** runs every 6 hours (00:00, 06:00, 12:00, 18:00 UTC)
2. **🌿 Randomization Engine** decides whether to plant (85% chance) or rest (15% chance)
3. **🌳 Tree Generator** creates forests with 1-4 trees per run
4. **🌲 Forest Variety** randomly selects from 2 different tree types
5. **🌴 Auto-planting** adds forests to `progress.md` with natural timing
6. **🌱 Your profile** becomes a growing digital forest on GitHub!

## 📋 Requirements

- A GitHub repository (the soil for your forest)
- A love for green squares and digital trees
- A sense of humor about your GitHub profile

## ⚙️ Setup

1. **🌱 Fork this repository** (or create your own with these files)
2. **🌿 Enable GitHub Actions** in your repository
3. **🌳 Sit back and watch your forest grow**

## 📝 Sample Forest

Your `progress.md` will look something like this:

```markdown
# Daily Motivational Message

- 🌲 🌳 🌲 🌳 🌲
- 🌳 🌲 🌳 🌲
- 🌲 🌳 🌲
- 🌳 🌲 🌳 🌲 🌲 🌳
```

*Note: Some runs might be skipped (15% chance), and some might have multiple trees, creating a natural-looking contribution pattern with growing forests of 🌲 and 🌳 trees!*

## 🌲 The Tree Types

Our forest features two beautiful tree species:
- **🌲 Evergreen Tree**: The classic pine, always green and reliable
- **🌳 Deciduous Tree**: The leafy tree, bringing variety to your forest

## 🎪 Why plant a digital forest?

Look, we all know that:
- GitHub's contribution graph is basically a productivity beauty contest
- Recruiters judge you by the color of your squares
- Your self-worth shouldn't depend on green pixels
- But here we are, growing digital forests

This project is a playful commentary on that reality. It's like planting a garden - everyone knows it's artificial, but it's still beautiful and satisfying to watch grow.

## 🛠️ Technical Details

- **Language**: YAML (GitHub Actions)
- **Schedule**: Cron job every 6 hours
- **Forest Generation**: Random tree selection and placement
- **Commit Strategy**: Single commit per run with all trees
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if anything goes wrong

## 🤝 Contributing

Want to make this forest even more amazing? Contributions are welcome! Some ideas:
- Add more tree emoji varieties
- Implement seasonal changes
- Create themed forest patterns
- Add forest creatures (squirrels, birds, etc.)

*Remember: A green GitHub profile doesn't make you a better developer, but it does make you feel better about yourself. And sometimes that's enough.* 🌱✨

*Keep growing, keep coding, keep your forest green!* 🌲🌳🌴
