# 🌱 GH-GreenKeeper

*Growing forests to keep your GitHub profile green, one tree at a time*

![GitHub Contribution Graph Example](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=1000,height=420,fit=cover,gravity=auto,format=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fexirmgixmnkgwo40q1ig.PNG)

*This is what your contribution graph could look like with GH-GreenKeeper - a lush, verdant forest of green squares!*

## 🌲 What is this forest?

Welcome to **GH-GreenKeeper**, where we plant digital trees to transform your GitHub contribution graph into a thriving forest. Instead of motivational quotes, we grow actual forests of tree emojis that keep your profile looking fresh and green.

This project automatically plants trees in your repository 4 times a day, ensuring your GitHub profile stays as green as a spring meadow. Because nothing says "productive developer" like a perfectly green contribution graph, right?

## 🎯 Features

- **🌲 Tree Emoji Forests**: Plants beautiful tree emojis instead of boring text
- **🌳 Natural Growth Pattern**: Each commit adds exactly one tree for consistent green squares
- **🌴 Variable Session Activity**: 0-4 commits per 6-hour session for realistic activity patterns
- **🌵 Sustainable Growth**: Each tree gets its own commit, creating authentic contribution history
- **🎄 Forest Variety**: 2 different tree types (🌲 evergreen, 🌳 deciduous)
- **🎋 Perfect Lines**: Exactly 20 trees per line for uniform forest rows
- **🎍 Individual Commits**: Each tree is committed separately for maximum GitHub activity
- **🎎 Realistic Timing**: 4 sessions per day, but not every session needs to be active

## 🚀 How the forest grows

1. **🌱 GitHub Actions** runs every 6 hours (00:00, 06:00, 12:00, 18:00 UTC)
2. **🌿 Session Planning** decides how many commits to make (0, 1, 2, 3, or 4)
3. **🌳 Individual Planting** creates one commit per tree, each adding exactly one tree
4. **🌲 Forest Variety** randomly selects from 2 different tree types for each tree
5. **🌴 Auto-planting** adds trees to `progress.md` with natural timing
6. **🌱 Your profile** becomes a growing digital forest on GitHub!

## 📋 Requirements

- A GitHub repository (the soil for your forest)
- A love for green squares and digital trees
- A sense of humor about your GitHub profile

## ⚙️ Setup

1. **🌱 Fork this repository** (or create your own with these files)
2. **🌿 Enable GitHub Actions** in your repository
3. **🌳 Sit back and watch your forest grow**

## 📝 Sample Forest

Your `progress.md` will look something like this:

```
- 🌲 🌳 🌲 🌳 🌲 🌳 🌲 🌳 🌲 🌳 🌲 🌳 🌲 🌳 🌲 🌳 🌲 🌳 🌲 🌳
- 🌳 🌲 🌲 🌳 🌲 🌳 🌲 🌲 🌳 🌲 🌳 🌲 🌳 🌲 🌳 🌲 🌳 🌲 🌳 🌲
- 🌲 🌳 🌳 🌲 🌳 🌲 🌳 🌲 🌲 🌳 🌲 🌳 🌲 🌳 🌲 🌳 🌲 🌳 🌲 🌳
```

*Note: Each line will have exactly 20 trees. New trees are added to existing lines until they reach 20, then a new line is started. Each tree gets its own commit, creating authentic GitHub activity!*

## 🌲 The Tree Types

Our forest features two beautiful tree species:
- **🌲 Evergreen Tree**: The classic pine, always green and reliable
- **🌳 Deciduous Tree**: The leafy tree, bringing variety to your forest

## 🎪 Why plant a digital forest?

Look, we all know that:
- GitHub's contribution graph is basically a productivity beauty contest
- Recruiters judge you by the color of your squares
- Your self-worth shouldn't depend on green pixels
- But here we are, growing digital forests

This project is a playful commentary on that reality. It's like planting a garden - everyone knows it's artificial, but it's still beautiful and satisfying to watch grow.

## 🛠️ Technical Details

- **Language**: YAML (GitHub Actions)
- **Schedule**: Cron job every 6 hours
- **Commit Strategy**: 0-4 commits per session, each adding exactly 1 tree
- **Forest Generation**: Random tree selection, one per commit
- **Activity Pattern**: Realistic variation in daily activity (0-16 commits per day)
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if anything goes wrong

## 📊 Daily Activity Patterns

With 4 sessions per day and 0-4 commits per session, your daily activity will vary naturally:
- **Minimum**: 0 commits (all sessions decide to rest)
- **Maximum**: 16 commits (all sessions make 4 commits each)
- **Typical**: 6-10 commits (realistic developer activity patterns)

This creates authentic-looking GitHub activity that doesn't look too robotic or predictable!

## 🤝 Contributing

*Remember: A green GitHub profile doesn't make you a better developer, but it does make you feel better about yourself. And sometimes that's enough.* 🌱✨

*Keep growing, keep coding, keep your forest green!* 🌲🌳🌴
